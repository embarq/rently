# Rently [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/embarq/rently/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/embarq/rently/tree/master)

## Development

- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies(npm recommended)
- Download runtime config via `npm run appconfig`
- Use one of the scripts from the list below

## Scripts

|Topic|Script|
|-----|------|
|General development|`serve`|
|Development SSR build|`build:all:dev`|
|Production SSR build|`build:all`|
|Interact with SSR|`firebase serve`|
|Download runtime config|`appconfig`|

## SSR development notes

- The SSR part was initially generated using Angular CLI as described in [official docs](https://angular.io/guide/universal)
- Since the project heavily depends on Firebase services(using AngularFire wrapper) we need to some fixes in regards building/packaging firebase sources:
  - [`webpack.server.config.js`] Point out modules resolution order in `resolve.mainFields`
  - [`webpack.server.config.js`] Modify `externals` - add `/^firebase/` entry since Firebase has some troubles being bundled when in the Node environment
  - [`webpack.server.config.js`] Provide `output.libraryTarget` & `output.library` data because we want to run out SSR server in the Firebase function called `ssr`
  - Move firebase web config into functions remote config. You can download remote config using `npm run appconfig`
  - [`src/app/core/core.module.ts`] Replace generic `AngularFireModule.initializeApp({ })` with manual initialization of `FirebaseOptionsToken` with value from `environment`
- `server.ts` file generated by Angular CLI was enhanced with logging and some fixes:
  - Add important pollyfils for firebase running in node
  - Rewrite `Express.Request.originalUrl` from to absolute to relative path. Original url initially comes as `https://{firebase-project-id}/{page-route}`. We need to get rid of the first part for Angular Router to correctly resolve path within the frontend app navigation
  - Instead of listening the SSR server it needs to be exported for cloud function to actually run it

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
